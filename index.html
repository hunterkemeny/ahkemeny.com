                            <p>Building a neutral atom quantum computer with cesium and sodium atoms. I completed the design and construction of a new ultra-high-vacuum chamber. This upgrade positions the experiment to reach higher Rabi frequencies on sodium and suppress stray-field-induced dephasing, key parameters for the high-fidelity quantum operations we plan to demonstrate in the coming year. In parallel, I wrote FPGA-based control code that automatically locks our excitation lasers, eliminating daily manual tuning; I also installed a new optical breadboard for the improved imaging fidelity of sodium. Ultimately, I aim to use AI and automation techniques to build a self-driving lab.</p>

                            <p>While I was a visiting student at MIT EECS in 2023, I started building ChatTutor, an AI embedded into class websites that is fully aware of all coursework. Many MIT professors were enthusiastic to use the tool, so I brought on Aatmik Mallya, one of my best friends from high school, and we co-founded ChatTutor, Inc. For this work, I was invited to speak at MIT Generative AI Day in 2023.</p>

                            <!-- <p>I co-led a team of ~10 open-source developers to build ChatTutor for courses at MIT, BYU, and University of Arizona. Through word of mouth, we were introduced to Professor Liesl Folks, Director of the Center for Semiconductor Manufacturing at UofA. We partnered to build a version of ChatTutor for their new course in semiconductor manufacturing being taught at a school in Arizona called Hamilton High School. Out of totally random coincidence, this just happened to be the high school where Aatmik and I graduated.</p> -->
                            <p>We soon realized that a simple RAG chatbot doesn't take advantage of the full power of modern AI tools. I envisioned an entire learning platform with AI threaded into every workflow. It can grade assignments, learn students strengths/weaknesses like a human tutor, and come up with practice tailored for the needs of a class or even specific students. Aatmik and I built this platform, called Inkwell, in 6 weeks on top of our PhDs.</p>

                            <p>A significant portion of the excellent research in quantum computing takes place in industrial labs. In summer 2022, I was lucky to be accepted to the Quantum Undergraduate Research at IBM and Princeton program where I had the opportunity to work on benchmarking IBM's superconducting quantum computers in Yorktown Heights. </p>
                            <p>I investigated experiments traditionally performed in the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) setting—like spin-locking T₁ρ, Hahn echo, T₂*, etc—and applied them to benchmark the quantum coherence of superconducting qubits. </p>
                            <img src="spin_locking_animation.gif" class="spin-locking-gif" alt="Spin locking animation" />
                            <blockquote><em></em>Spin-locking pulse sequence for coherence preservation in quantum systems. Left panel: With spin-locking, the quantum state remains largely preserved, indicating maintained quantum coherence. Right panel: Without spin-locking, free evolution leads to rapid dephasing and decoherence, evidenced by the shrinking arrow length. Bottom panel: Pulse sequence timing showing the three-pulse protocol with time progression indicator. The comparison clearly illustrates how spin-locking techniques can significantly extend quantum coherence lifetimes by suppressing environmental decoherence effects, making this a crucial tool for quantum information processing and NMR spectroscopy applications.</em></blockquote>
                            <p>The benchmarks I created are used as an extension of Qiskit Experiments to test the coherence times of qubits across topologies of superconducting quantum circuits like the one shown below.</p>

                            <p>Quantum computers will ultimately revolutionize a vast array of fields, from drug discovery to cryptography and materials design. After spending several years in the field, I wanted to see what applications quantum technologies are enabling <em>today</em>. One area is quantum sensing, which has already proved useful for neuroimaging and gravitational wave detection in LIGO. Thus, I joined Professor Dirk Englund's lab collaborating with Honda Research Initiative on quantum sensors to enable vehicle navigation in GPS-denied areas.</p>
                            <p>I derived information-theoretic bounds for networks of quantum magnetometers—advanced sensors that measure magnetic fields more accurately than classical sensors—defining fundamental performance limits. I then pulled on work from computational fluid dynamics to implement a machine learning algorithm for reconstructing continuous magnetic fields given a small set of sensor measurements. </p>

                            <p>After spending sophomore year researching trapped-ion quantum computers, I wanted to learn more about other promising platforms for quantum computing. Google and IBM have both heavily invested in superconducting qubits, a quantum technology that uses ultra-cold superconductors as giant atoms to support quantum dynamics. Intrigued by the strong focus from industry players on this technology, I joined Professor Andrew Houck's group at Princeton in summer 2022 where I worked on superconducting quantum memories.</p>
                            <p>One promising avenue for quantum memories is "slow light", a phenomenon that occurs when the group velocity of photons is reduced to near zero. Circuits can be engineered to create slow light, but finding geometries small enough to fit on a superconducting chip can be challenging. To this end, I found a simple lattice geometry[1] supporting slow light and simulated circuit dynamics to determine if population revival—a key condition for quantum memory in our chosen regime—could be observed under realistic experimental disorders. </p>

(a) Upper panel: Real-time visualization of photon population dynamics. A single qubit (large node) is coupled to the central resonator. (b) Lower panel: Qubit population vs. time showing characteristic revival dynamics. The numbered points mark critical phases: (1) initial excitation (t = 0 μs), (2) population minimum as photons tunnel into the lattice (t ≈ 1.5 μs), (3) revival peak as photons return to the qubit (t ≈ 3.0 μs), and (4) final equilibrium state (t ≈ 7.2 μs). The slow-light dynamics enable non-Markovian quantum revival, demonstrating enhanced qubit-photon interaction time scales for quantum information processing applications.</em></blockquote>
                            <p>This simulation successfully demonstrated revival behavior, a promising indicator for this device's potential for supporting quantum memory. For this work, I was selected by Duke as a finalist for the Barry M Goldwater Scholarship. You can read my writeup here.</p>

                            <p>After becoming obsessed with the science of disease and aging, I wanted to build new technologies that could accelerate research toward eventual cures. Quantum computing's promise to aid in drug discovery led me to join Professor Kenneth Brown's lab at <a href="https://quantum.duke.edu/" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duke Quantum Center</a> building trapped-ion quantum computers.</p>
                            <p>A key objective for quantum computing experiments is the optimization of gate fidelity, which measures how often quantum gates produce desired outputs. However, methods to improve fidelity are typically specialized for a single type of gate and specific experimental apparatus. I developed a general tool that optimizes laser pulse amplitudes and frequencies to implement a wide class of high-fidelity gates for trapped-ion platforms.</p>
                            <!-- <p>I first derived a mathematical expression relating any choice of laser pulse sequences with the resulting phase-space dynamics of trapped ions. I used this expression to define a cost function and build a gradient-based optimization engine in Pytorch that determines optimal pulse frequencies/amplitudes to drive desired quantum gate evolution. Importantly, my optimization protocol ensures that motional modes return to their ground states, avoiding decoherence from residual phonon excitations. I also included a sophisticated noise model that accounts for motional heating, laser phase noise, and dephasing effects; my optimizer discovered robust pulse sequences that maintain 99.9%+ fidelity in simulations of noisy five-ion quantum computers.</p> -->

(b) Pulse frequency evolution over time showing the optimized frequency modulation pattern. (c) Gaussian-shaped Rabi frequency envelope demonstrating the amplitude modulation of the laser field. (d) XX-rotation angle evolution showing the target π/4 rotation required for the two-qubit entangling gate. The optimization successfully creates the desired entangling operation while minimizing residual motional excitation.</blockquote>
                            <p>Using my tool, experimentalists can easily find optimal gates for their experimental configurations by inputting the trap parameters (like mode frequencies and Lamb-Dicke parameters) on the command line. This work led to a collaboration with <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/quantum/quantum-information-sciences/projects/qscout/" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandia National Labs</a> where I interfaced my gate-fidelity optimizer with Sandia's quantum assembly language, enabling experiments with my gates on their trapped-ion platform.</p>

                            <p>For years, my main focus has been building new technologies with the goal of accelerating our species towards curing all disease and aging. But I also had a lifelong dream of exploring fundamental questions about our universe. I realized this dream when I returned to college after my gap years and joined Professor Ashutosh Kotwal's research group investigating potential dark matter signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</p>
                            <p>The LHC creates high-energy proton collisions, generating thousands of particle fragments detected by cylindrical arrays of pixel sensors. Identifying metastable particles, potential indicators of dark matter, within this immense data volume is computationally challenging—existing CPUs cannot process collision data quickly enough. To address this, I designed an FPGA-based algorithm that significantly accelerates real-time identification of these particle trajectories through graph-computing and unsupervised learning.</p>
                            <img src="multi_example_tracking1.gif" class="particle-tracking-gif" alt="Particle tracking algorithm demonstration" />
                            <blockquote><em>Examples of the track-finding ability of the algorithm, demonstrated on simulated data. Cocentric cylindrical sensors with radii 5cm-25cm detect particle fragments from collisions. The red points represent hits associated with the high-momentum particle of interest, and the blue points represent hits from random noise. We begin with a fully connected graph of all possible particle paths, then our algorithm systematically eliminates unlikely paths. The red curve indicates that the simulated metastable particle trajectory is successfully identified. The embedded metastable particle has a transverse momentum of 10 GeV/c and traverses an axial magnetic field of 2 T.</em></blockquote>
                            <p>Our solution achieved state-of-the-art throughput of less than 250 nanoseconds per collision, a 100x improvement over existing LHC capabilities.
