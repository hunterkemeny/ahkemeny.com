                            <p>Building a neutral atom quantum computer with cesium and sodium atoms. I completed the design and construction of a new ultra-high-vacuum chamber. This upgrade positions the experiment to reach higher Rabi frequencies on sodium and suppress stray-field-induced dephasing, key parameters for the high-fidelity quantum operations we plan to demonstrate in the coming year. In parallel, I wrote FPGA-based control code that automatically locks our excitation lasers, eliminating daily manual tuning; I also installed a new optical breadboard for the improved imaging fidelity of sodium. Ultimately, I aim to use AI and automation techniques to build a self-driving lab.</p>

                            <p>I co-founded Inkwell with the aim of providing ultra-personalized education for students and supercharging teachers with AI grading & analytics. I first co-led a team of 10 open-source developers building generative AI tutors that generate Courses, Labs, and MIT course content. I've organized Laboratory in Quantum Systems Engineering and BT05 Photonics Bootcamp. I realized that bolting chatbots onto existing courseware left powerful capabilities on the table, so I have invested the past several months in building Inkwell, the next generation of EdTech. I currently have $300k revenue and are working with our clients at the NSF and Center for Semiconductor Manufacturing to deploy Inkwell in classrooms this fall. I was invited to present this work at MIT Generative AI Week¹ as well as the Fairness with ChatGPT Workshop² at the University of Chicago.</p>

                            <h3>Unsupervised Learning for Particle Tracking @ Large Hadron Collider</h3>
                            <p><em>CERN | Researcher, PI: Professor Ashutosh Kotwal</em></p>
                            <p>During my gap years, I self-studied physics with the goal of returning to college and pursuing a lifelong dream of exploring fundamental questions about our universe. This dream was realized when I joined Professor Ashutosh Kotwal's research group, which investigates potential dark matter signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</p>
                            <p>The LHC creates high-energy proton collisions, generating thousands of particle fragments detected by cylindrical arrays of pixel sensors. Identifying metastable particles, potential indicators of dark matter, within this immense data volume is computationally challenging—existing CPUs cannot process collision data quickly enough. To address this, I designed an FPGA-based AI algorithm that significantly accelerates real-time identification of these critical particle trajectories through graph-computing and unsupervised learning techniques.</p>
                            <img src="multi_example_tracking.gif" class="particle-tracking-gif" alt="Particle tracking algorithm demonstration" />
                            <p><em>Examples of the track-finding ability of the algorithm, demonstrated on simulated data. The C code used for FPGA synthesis is executed as software to emulate the algorithm's hardware results. The red points represent the hits associated with the high-momentum particle of interest, and the blue points represent hits from random noise. The red curve shows the trajectory identified by the algorithm. The embedded particle has a transverse momentum of 10 GeV/c and traverses an axial magnetic field of 2 T.</em></p>
                            <p>Our solution achieved an unprecedented throughput of less than 25 nanoseconds per event, a thousand-fold improvement over existing LHC capabilities. This work culminated in my co-authoring a paper published in <em>Nature Scientific Reports</em>, marking a meaningful step towards enabling new physics discoveries at the LHC.</p>

                            <p class="research-section">After my freshman year of college, I took two gap years to self-study computer science, math, and physics. In the process, I had a few startup ideas and co-founded a company with my friends from high school. The first was called <a href="kronacash-website/index.html" class="page-link">KronaCash</a>, an app to save you as much money as possible. We taught ourselves web and mobile development from scratch and started building a pipeline to find all applicable coupons and rewards whenever the user swiped their credit card. It was like Honey but for in-person retail.</p>

                            <p class="research-section">When the pandemic hit, we realized it was impossible to collect the data we needed from local brick and mortar to aggregate coupons and rewards. Simultaneously, I read Lifespan by David Sinclair and became obsessed with health and longevity, so we pivoted to building an all-in-one personalized health app suggesting workouts, diet, mindfulness, etc. This was <a href="https://github.com/hunterkemeny/OneHealth" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneHealth</a>.</p>

                            <p class="research-section">We were on the app store for a while, and although I love startups and programming with my friends, I ultimately decided to focus on developing deep scientific technical skills so I could work on building next-generation technologies like AI and quantum computers. </p>
