                <p>I'm endlessly grateful for my excellent teachers and friends who actively support my learning. Many of the pivotal moments in my intellectual development have come from recommendations by people in my community. So, to give back, I've compiled a list of books, articles, and videos that have had the greatest impact on my thinking; many of these items on were recommendations, and now I'm passing them on to you. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Books</h2>
                <p><em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em> by Walter Miller is the single most important book in my intellectual development. It forced me to recognize the importance of responsibility in pursuing cutting edge science (e.g. developing nuclear weapons), and also question our society's capacity to morally utilize the knowledge produced by scientific research. Miller also introduced me to an interesting interpretation of religion that is much fuller than the straw men I'm used to dealing with (thanks to characters like Sam Harris). </p>
                <p>Descartes' <em>Meditations</em> introduced me to Skepticism and changed how I view epistemology forever. I've spent many sleepless nights attempting to prove that I'm not a brain in a vat. One day I'll write an essay on my progress, but for now, I can only assume you're sentient...</p>
                <p>The <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> is my favorite piece of philosophy ever written. The first half of the Tractatus is extremely intuitive to me and very similar to how I already view the world (so long as I'm interpreting it correctly). I can't say anything better than Wittgenstein puts it; all I can do is recommend that you read it. I'm itching to know how Wittgenstein evolved in his thinking later in life, which is why I'm taking a course on late Wittgenstein this fall.</p>
                <p><em>Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth</em>. Simply a masterpiece. I've never read a comic with such beautiful art, psychological depth, and powerful storytelling. The line between the superhero and supervillan appears subject to Brownian motion.</p>
                <p><em>Man's Search For Meaning</em> by Victor Frankel was my first encounter with the cruel details of the Holocaust outside of an academic setting. It showed me that people can endure suffering much worse than they could ever imagine, but only if they have a deeply ingrained purpose. </p>
                <p><em>Lifespan</em> by David Sinclair gave me hope that I was born in time to reach longevity escape velocity. Aging and disease suck; maybe we're lucky enough to live in an era where scientific progress can completely mitigate them. I hope to be a part of this progress.</p>
                <p>I know I've talked trash about self-help books, but <em>Can't Hurt Me</em> by Navy SEAL David Goggins is the best self-help book in existence, written by someone who regularly accomplishes superhuman tasks. I have taken nearly all of Goggins' advice and it has completely reframed how I approach productivity and sharpening skills.</p>
                <p>I haven't read as much historical literature as I would like, but <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> taught me that people have held deep beliefs about the universe, heroes, and death since the beginning of civilization. For some reason, people today seem to think that earlier generations are essentially cavemen compared to them, but reading The Epic showed me that, across millenia, very little about the human experience has changed. Plato's <em>Apology</em> introduced me to the source of Socratic inquiry, and it is enlightening to read the genesis of Western philosophical and scientific thought. </p>
                <p>A short list of my other favorite books: <em>1984</em>, <em>The Count of Monte Christo</em>, <em>The Book Thief</em>, <em>The Graveyard Book</em>, <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Textbooks</h2>
                <p>I recommend <em>Basic Mathematics</em> by Serge Lang for anyone who was unsatisfied with the rigor of their high school mathematics courses. This book helped me review precalculus before self-studying from MIT OCW and got me acquainted with proofs. If you want additional practice with proofs, check out <em>A Transition to Advanced Mathematics</em> by Chartrand. Doing hundreds of problems in this book helped me understand how to get deep in math, build a system of theorems from axioms and lemmas, and construct clear, concise, and complete proofs.</p>
                <p><em>Calculus Vol 1</em> by Tom Apostol rigorously develops single variable calculus from the field and order axioms. This is the book that convinced me to major in math. Deeply understanding the concepts I found fascinating in introductory calculus and learning how those concepts rested on top of other theorems and axioms blew my mind.</p>
                <p><em>Quantum Computation and Quantum Information</em> by Nielsen and Chuang introduced me to quantum computing and is excellent for learning about interesting theoretical concepts without having previously studied quantum mechanics. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Articles</h2>
                <p>"The Original Affluent Society" by Michael Sahlins showed me that everything we are taught about hunter-gatherer societies is a capitalist farce. These people were not savages, they were not starving, they were not restless. The idea that our current society is the result of a linear progression beginning with seemingly hard people with meaningless lives is complete nonsense invented to brainwash people into thinking that endless productivity is the only way to feed themselves. In reality, people in these ancient societies worked very little, rarely starved, and had leisurely lives. They were definitionally "affluent"; poverty is a modern invention that exists only due to wealth hoarding.</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Become a Hacker</a> set me straight on the difference between hacking and cracking. It also helped guide the programming languages and software I learned at the beginning of my programming career.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.mccurley.org/advice/hamming_advice.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hamming Advice</a> was pivotal in helping me figure out how to choose problems that are worth working on, and also that the ability to present my ideas well is important; I feel this last lesson rings especially true in our age of disinformation.</p>
                <p>Learning to write good proofs and transitioning to advanced mathematics is tough; the inability to write a proof can be a serious blow to one's ego and self-confidence. <a href="http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/gowers/gowers_VIII_6.pdf" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advice to Young Mathematicians</a>, <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Poincare_Intuition/" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poincare on intuition in mathematics</a>, and Terrence Tao's <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There's more to math than rigour and proofs</a> were monumental in helping me understand the purpose of proof in mathematics. A proof isn't the end-all-be-all of math, just a tool of mathematical discovery. Intuition is still essential, and heuristic reasoning guides proof writing itself. That's why understanding Polya's <em>How To Solve It!</em> is so important.</p> 
                <p>Carl Sagan's <a href="https://highexistence.com/carl-sagans-profound-essay-on-why-cannabis-consciousness-is-desperately-needed-in-this-mad-and-dangerous-world/" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. X</a> essay investigates the scientist's relationship with weed. His reported experiences on the drug are very reflective of my own, except that he didn't experience anxiety or panic attacks.</p>
                <p>I am a huge proponent of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a> and spaced repetition learning. At this moment, I have made over 15,000 cards, though I only know 10,000 of them currently. Nielsen's article <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> redefined how I write Anki cards and have imporved my efficiency and retention. You must atomize!</p>
                <p>When I was getting my startup off the ground, a friend recommended that I read Paul Graham's essays. There are too many good ones to give you a comprehensive list, but some of my favorites are <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relentlessly Resourceful</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Nerds are Unpopular</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cities and Ambition</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Make Wealth</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undergraduation</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What You'll Wish You'd Known</a>, and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do Things that Don't Scale</a>.</p>
                <p>Scott Aaronson's <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> never fails to be fascinating.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Podcasts and Videos</h2>
                <p>Lex Fridman has the best podcast on the web. Some of my favorite interviews are with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX5t8EivCaM" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Aaronson</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM&t=1998s" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joscha Bach</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez773teNFYA" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Wolfram</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t06rkOOUa7g&t=3002s" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manolis Kellis</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB8zcAttP1E&t=11700s" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Fravor</a>. Andrew Huberman also hosts an excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a> on neuroscience. I would be remiss not to mention Dan Carlin's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dancarlinpodcaster/videos" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardcore History</a>, which is essential listening for those who love history. I also highly recommend <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This American Life</a>.</p>
                <p>When I was younger, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vsauce</a> captivated my imagination by using science to explore deep questions that always lead to deeper truths. I attribute this channel to sparking my interest in science and encouraging me to pursue it as a career. I recommend you check out the old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbqGsjWTt40&list=PL2E357C14C00D6089" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mind Blows</a> from Vsuace2. It's interesting to see how many cool tech ideas never panned out, but also the few that did and have since been integrated into our lives. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veratasium</a> produces similar content. Other science creators I like are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNbYGl89UUowy8oXkipC-Q" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr Becky</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnFmWQbVW_YbqPQZGNuq8sA" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Dotson</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtAIs1VCQrymlAnw3mGonhw" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flammable Maths</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzaYH6WeohiHKj3Ih_GdZdQ" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anastasia Marchenkova</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LookingGlassUniverse" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking Glass Universe</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tibees" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tibees</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g" class="page-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PBS Spacetime</a>.</p>
